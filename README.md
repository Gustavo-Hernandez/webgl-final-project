# webgl-final-project

This project is part of the Computational Graphics Class.

The purpose of this project is to create a 3D visualization of an object and applying different transformations to it.
The objects and thematic chosen for the project are the following:
    - Main object: Spaceship that "evades" asteriods.
    - Secondary objects: Asteroids and planets.
    - Transformations: 
        - The spacechip moves from the left side to right side of the canvas
          and at the same time it goes up and down. (Simulating an arc)
        - Asteroids move from the center to the bottom of the canvas.
        - Planets do a simple rotation.
